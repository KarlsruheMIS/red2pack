# red2pack

## Description
This project provides a branch-andâ€“reduce and heuristic solver for the maximum 2-packing set problem.
They apply novel 2-packing set reductions exhaustively in a preprocessing step and transforms the kernel an equivalent MIS instance.

## Dependencies
- GCC 13.1.0 or newer
- cmake 3.16 or newer

## Setup (Linux/MacOS)
Run the following to setup git submodules.
```shell
git submodule --init update
```

## Build and use our algorithms (Linux/MacOS)
The implementation of our algorithms are located in `lib/algorithms`. 
We solve the MIS problem using the wighted branch-and-reduce and OnlineMIS solver of KaMIS. Please, make sure to run the `init.sh` script beforehand.

To build the executable, please run:
```shell
bash compile_withcmake.sh
```

The scripts installs two binaries in `./branch_and_reduce/deploy`.
They allow you to benchmark our algorithms:
- `red2pack_branch_and_reduce` using the weighted-branch-and-reduce solver from KaMIS
- `red2pack_heuristic` using OnlineMIS

Use `--help` for an overview of the options. Probably, the following script does all what you want:
```bash
RED2PACK_SOLVER=./deploy/red2pack_branch_and_reduce # or /deploy/red2pack_heuristic
RED2PACK_REDUCTION_STYLE=elaborated # or "core" or "none"
SEED=0
TIMELIMIT=300 # seconds
GRAPH=tests/graphs/lesmis.graph
LOG=$SEED-$TIMELIMIT-$RED2PACK_REDUCTION_STYLE-$(basename $RED2PACK_SOLVER)-$(basename ${GRAPH%.graph}).log
$RED2PACK_SOLVER $GRAPH --seed=$SEED --timelimit=$TIMELIMIT --reduction_style2=$RED2PACK_REDUCTION_STYLE --console_log=$LOG
```

## How to use our reduction pack `red2pack`
If you want to use only our reduction pack `red2pack`, e.g. you want to build your own maximum 2-packing-set solver,
then the following tutorial will help you.

1. Start a new CMake project,
2. Install red2pack as a recursive submodule
3. Start a new class for your solver that inherits from `lib/solver_scheme.h` and implement `solve_mis` that solves the MIS problem.
4. Add a main function that calls your solver (similar to `/app/bnr/red2pack_branch_and_reduce.cpp`).
5. Add the following in your CMakeLists.txt and adapt it to your setup  
```cmake
include_directories(path/to/red2pack)
add_subdirectory(path/to/red2pack)
add_executable(solver solver.cpp $<TARGET_OBJECTS:libkaffpa2> $<TARGET_OBJECTS:libsources> $<TARGET_OBJECTS:libred2pack>)
```
