For the algorithm that uses redumis + preparation of the graph(reductions) use:
KaMIS_pack and after compiling use 'redupack' with the graph you want to use as input (maybe also --seed=<int> --time_limit=<time_in_seconds>)

For the algorithm that uses the branch and reduce algorithm + preparation of the graph(reductions) use: 
First use prepare_graph with the graph as input to run the reductions followed by condensing the graph. This will output the reduced condensed graph.
Afterwards run weighted_branch_reduce as it is done in KaMIS.

For the algorithm where we only condense and afterwards use redumis or weighted_branch_reduce use: 
compile the run_cond.cpp file and run it with the graph as input. The output will be the condensed graph. Then use KaMIS as usual (not included here)

For the genetic algorithm: In the first few lines: set the variable n_nodes to the actual number of nodes. Create a directory called 'instances' where
you store the graph that you want to use.
