 2-Packing Set

## Description
This project provides a branch-andâ€“reduce solver for the maximum 2-packing set problem.
The branch-and-reduce solver applies novel 2-packing set reductions exhaustively and transforms the kernel to solve it 
as an equivalent MIS instance.
This MIS instance is solved using the weighted branch-and-reduce solver from [KaMIS](https://github.com/KarlsruheMIS/KaMIS).

## Dependencies
- GCC 13.1.0 or newer
- cmake 3.16 or newer
- Python3 (for setup and benchmark)

## Setup (Linux/MacOS)
In following, the script downloads external benchmark sets from GitHub,
and translates them from the GML format to the METIS graph format.
All graphs are moved to `./graphs/`.
Moreover, it downloads KaMIS for the weighted branch-and-reduce solver for MIS problems.
Execute the following commands:
```shell
bash init.sh
```

## Build and use our algorithms (Linux/MacOS)
Note: If you want to use the out-of-the-box experiment, skip this section and go to [Experiment](#Experiment).

The implementation of our algorithms `red2pack core/elaborated` and `2pack` are located in `./branch_and_reduce`.
The implementation of `red2pack heuristic` is located in `./heuristic`.
We solve the MIS problem using the wighted branch-and-reduce and OnlineMIS solver of KaMIS. Please, make sure to run the `init.sh` script beforehand.


To build the executable, please run:
```shell
cd branch_and_reduce && bash compile_withcmake.sh && cd ../
cd heuristic && bash compile_withcmake.sh && cd ../
```

The scripts installs four binaries in `./branch_and_reduce/deploy`:
- `m2s_branch_and_reduce` provides our the implementations for `red2pack core/elaborated` and `2pack`
- `check_connected` to check whether a graph in connected. It is used for the competitor algorithm `gen2pack`
- `check_graph` to check whether a M2PS-to-MIS condensed graph (with or without reductions) is small enough for the weighted branch-and-reduce solver from KaMIS (32 bit limit for Node/Edge representation)
- `graph_to_gml` translates an undirected unweighted graph from the METIS format to the GML format
The scripts installs four binaries in `./heuristic/deploy`:
- `m2s_heuristic` provides our the implementations for `red2pack heuristic`

Use `--help` for an overview of the options or take a look in our example experiment `run_expriment.sh`.

## Build and use the competitor algorithms (Linux/MacOS)
Note: If you want to use the out-of-the-box experiment, skip this section and go to [Experiment](#Experiment).

We compare our algorithms to two competitor algorithms: gen2pack by Trejo et al. and Apx-2P+Im-2p by Trejo and Sanchez.
After correspondence with the authors, we modified the original source-code for Apx-2P+Imp-2P slightly to make it work -- however, we did not modify the algorithms themselves
and only added missing parts as described in the related papers. 

### gen2pack
gen2pack was implemented in Python an depends on multiple Python libraries.
We install them in a virtual environment for Python (venv).
To do so, run the following:
```shell
cd competitor/Gene2Pack && bash init.sh && cd ../../
```
To access the virtual environment:
```shell
source competitor/Gene2Pack/venv/bin/activate
```
The Python3 script is called `wake.py`. You can change the number of runs in `numExp` (default 1) in the script.
To solve a graph instance in GML format:
```shell
python3 competitor/Gene2Pack/wake.py <path_to_graph_instance> <out_dir>
```

### Apx-2p+Im-2p
Apx-2p+Im-2p was implemented in C++. 
It uses an optimization software library called Cplex from IBM. You can get a free academic version from [Cplex](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio).
To build Apx-2p+Im-2p, run the following snippet:
```shell
# set the path to the Cplex installation
CPLEX_ROOT_DIR=/Applications/CPLEX_Studio2211/
cd competitor/Approximate2Packing && bash compile_with_cmake.sh $CPLEX_ROOT_DIR && cd ../../
```
The path to the binary of Apx-2p+Im-2p is `competitor/Approximate2Packing/deploy/apx-2p`.


## Experiment
The following experiment works out of the box for a few example instances.
Just clone or download this repository and run `bash example_experiment.sh`.
The solution size (S) of the 2-packing set, the run time (t), the time to find a solution and proof optimality (t-p), the number of vertices (n) and edges of the transformed graph are written to `results.csv`.
For more details of the execution you can take a look into the output of the algorithms
in `./out_experiment`.
```shell
# init
INIT=1
USE_COMPETITOR_APX2P_IM2P=1
CPLEX_ROOT_DIR="Applications/CPLEX_Studio2211" # provide cplex root dir if you want to test the competitor algorithm Apx-2p+Im-2p
if [ $INIT == 1 ]; then
    if [ -d .git ]; then
      # initialize and update submodules
      git submodule update --init --recursive --force

### Experiments with other instances
We provide a script to run all algorithms (including competitor algorithms) for a single graph.
Please note, that the competitor `gen2pack` works only for connected graphs
and `Apx-2p + Imp2p` require outer planar graphs as input.
If you want to use a competitor, make sure an equivalent `graph.gml` is located in the same directory where `path_to_graph_filename.graph` is stored.
To translate a `.graph` (METIS format) to GML feel free to use our re-formatter tool `./branch_and_reduce/deploy/graph_to_gml`. 
```shell
bash run_experiment.sh <path_to_graph_filename> <use_genpack:1:0> <use_apx2p:1:0> <time_limit_in_sec>
```
