# 2-Packing Set

## Description
This project provides a branch-andâ€“reduce solver for the maximum 2-packing set problem.
The branch-and-reduce solvers applies exhaustively novel 2-packing set reductions and transforms the kernel to solve it 
as a equivalent MIS instance.
This MIS instance is solved using the weighted branch-and-reduce solver from [KaMIS](https://github.com/KarlsruheMIS/KaMIS).
